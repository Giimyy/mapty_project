# Mapty Project

Mapty is a project that uses a Geolocation API to determine the user's location and a third-party library called Leaflet to display a map on half of the page. The user can click anywhere on the map to add a cycling or running workout using a form. The workout data is then stored in a list and the local storage of the browser, so that the user doesn't loose his/her workout data whenever the come to for the next timne.

## ‚≠ê Using Mapty

When you first open the Mapty application, you will be prompted to allow the browser to access your location. If you allow access, the application will zoom in on your current location on the map. 

To add a workout, simply click on the map at the location where you want to start your workout. This will open a form where you can enter details about your workout, including the type of workout (cycling or running), the distance, the duration, and any notes you want to include.

After you submit the form, your workout will be added to the list of workouts on the left-hand side of the page. You can click on any workout in the list to view its location on the map.

To delete a workout, simply click on the "Delete" button in the specific workout you are interested to delete. You can also clear all workouts by clicking the "Clear Workouts" button at the bottom of the workout list.
